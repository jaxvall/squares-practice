## Installation and usage

If you're on Windows or Mac, you can download ([Windows](https://github.com/jaxvall/squares-practice/releases/latest/squares-practice.exe), [Mac](https://github.com/jaxvall/squares-practice/releases/latest/squares-practice.zip)) a standalone executable which you can run without having Python installed. 

In case you want to run the source code, download it from the [releases section](https://github.com/jaxvall/squares-practice/releases/latest) or clone the repo.

### I have never ran a Python file before, how do I do it?

It's not hard at all. First, download the latest Python version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, open the terminal at your downloaded source code location.

On Windows, while inside the folder in the file explorer, you can do this by writing "cmd" in the address bar or pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>, then <kbd>Enter</kbd>.<br />
On Mac, while in Finder, control-click the folder and choose "New Terminal at Folder".

While in the terminal, you simply run the file with one of these commands:
```bash
py main.py
```
```bash
python3 main.py
```
